            <strong>General</strong><br/>
            Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the Swiss Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG), 
            every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as protection against misuse of their personal data. 
            The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance 
            with the legal data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.<br/>
            <br/>
            In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized access, loss, 
            misuse or falsification.<br/>
            <br/>
            We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of 
            data against access by third parties is not possible.<br/>
            <br/>
            By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data in accordance with the following description. 
            This website can generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages accessed or names of files accessed, date and time are stored 
            on the server for statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, 
            address or e-mail address are collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. Without your consent, 
            the data will not be passed on to third parties.<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Cookies</strong><br/>
            This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific information related to the user on the user's 
            terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies make it possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of 
            users of the pages, to analyze behavior patterns of page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored beyond 
            the end of a browser session and can be retrieved when you visit the site again. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your Internet 
            browser so that it refuses to accept cookies.<br/><br/>A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared 
            for a large number of the services, especially in the case of tracking, via the U.S. site http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the 
            EU site http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be achieved by disabling them in the browser settings. 
            Please note that in this case not all functions of this online offer can be used.<br/>
